                <p>Goats are stout-bodied mammals with horns and cloven hooves. There are two types of goats: domestic goats (Capra hircus), which are raised and bred as farm animals; and mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), which live in steep, rocky areas in the American Northwest. 

                Goats are members of the Bovidae family, which also includes antelopes, cattle and sheep, according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS). Other members of the Capragenus include the ibex, markhors and turs, which are sometimes called wild goats. Mountain goats are the only living species in the genus Oreamnos.</p>

                <p>In his book titled GoatMan: How I Took A Holiday From Being a Human, Thwaites described how he adopted prosthetic hooves and attempted to eat a diet of grass in order to live more like a goat, after having thought for years that life would be much less stressful as an animal.</p>
